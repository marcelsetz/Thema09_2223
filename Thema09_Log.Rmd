Urinary biomarkers for pancreatic cancer

https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/urinary-biomarkers-for-pancreatic-
cancer

Research question: Is it possible to detect pancreatic cancer using values of the urinary biomarkers?

## Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadiest cancers. The chances of survival are increased when diagnosed in an early stage. However, PDAC shows symptoms when it already spread throughout the body. Most of the time, it's too late by then. There may be a way to detect PCAD in an early stage with a simple urine test, with the use of the following biomarkers: creatinine (Urinary biomarker of kidney function) LYVE1 (Urinary levels of Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, a protein that may play a role in tumor metastasis), REG1A and REG1B (Urinary levels of a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration.), and TFF1 (Urinary levels of Trefoil Factor 1, which may be related to regeneration and repair of the urinary tract)

the attributes in the data interesting for this research are the biomarker values mentioned before. There is also an attribute called diagnosis, in which the diagnosis of the sample is stated, where 1 means no PDAC, 2 means benign hepatobiliary disease (non cancerous, non harmful pancreatic condition), and 3 means that the sample has PDAC.
